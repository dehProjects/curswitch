1.  The "rig" was put together for test & debugging, so some repackaging
might be in order.

2. Blue Pill high voltage module glued to platform

Therefore, platform needs a spacer to sit flat.

3. Tamura 100a included

I had one with no immediate need. Calibration is based on this unit.

4. Screws

These are wood screws. They tend to crack the the top few layers of 
the post when they are screwed in. One hears a slight crack when 
they are first screwed in. At the time I had not found a source of 
self-tapping plastic screws.

5. Cabling ready to test

The interconnections are in place. These could be replaced by 
hard-wiring for a final package. Vias beside each RJ jack allow
easy soldering.

6. Aux contact feature not tested.

If something in the sw does not work with the Aux contact
feature the failure is to not connect. 

The hw has pull-up resistors so open circuit should appear as a
one bit in the sw. The hw should pull the line to gnd for closed
contact. The sw has a provision for reversing the sense for the
sw.

7. DMOC enable

The only test on this is that it pulls the line down for enable.
This is done after the program is in the CONNECTED state, which
has included a final contactor closure delay.

8. Flashing programs

I'm out of DiscoveryF4 boards, otherwise I would have included
one. The .doc file has a description of the connections for
using a DiscoveryF4 board.
